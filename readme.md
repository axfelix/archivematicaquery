This is a query/reporting tool for Archivematica. It's currently nothing special to look at and doesn't have very much functionality, but it's good for getting basic information out of ElasticSearch. It's written against the version of pyes that ships with Archivematica, so that it can be run on the same server (it starts on port 8080 by default). All you should need to do to get this running on a stock Archivematica install is install the Python Bottle web framework (pip install bottle), then do python queryfrontend.py. Runs on localhost:8080/reports by default. Enjoy!
